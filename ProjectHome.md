rdfQuery is an easy-to-use Javascript library for RDF-related processing. You can use it to parse RDFa embedded within your page, query over the facts it contains, and reason to produce more facts. In concert with an server-side triplestore, rdfQuery can be used to create interfaces for editing the semantic web.

rdfQuery comes in three flavours, with a minimised and a full Javascript release for each. The three flavours are:

  * **Core rdfQuery** enables you to create triplestores and query over those triplestores
  * **rdfQuery with RDFa** supports parsing RDFa and adding it to your page
  * **rdfQuery with rules** supports reasoning over triplestores using rules

To get started, [download](http://code.google.com/p/rdfquery/downloads/list) the latest release and read the [tutorial](http://code.google.com/p/rdfquery/wiki/RdfPlugin) or the [reference documentation](http://www.jenitennison.com/rdfquery).

rdfQuery depends on [jQuery](http://jquery.com) and, if you want to create serialised versions of JSON/RDF, the [jQuery-JSON plugin](http://code.google.com/p/jquery-json/), which need to get hold of separately.
